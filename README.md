*Handle tuples of N dimensions!* :abacus:

## About :books:

If you know maths and Python, you know that in both there exists a "data type" called a tuple.
I wanted to write a library that handles tuples of dimension `n`. This is that library.

## Installation :inbox_tray:

### Adding to your project

To add *Simple Tuple* to your project's dependencies, add this line to your project's `pubspec.yaml`:

#### From *GitHub*

```YAML
depdencies:
  ...
  simpletuple:
    git: git://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/simpletuple.git
```

#### From *Pub.dev*

```YAML
depdencies:
  ...
  simpletuple: ^1.3.0-nullsafety.0
```

The three dots represent anything else that you might have in the `dependencies` section. Having done that, re-fetch your project's dependencies by running this in the project's root directory:

```bash
$ dart pub get
```

## Usage :hammer:

### Importing

Import the API like this:

```dart
import 'package:simpletuple/simpletuple.dart';
```
